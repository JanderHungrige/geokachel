"""Just enough GeoTIFF to read a height raster.

Six services, three disagreements. Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and
Hessen return uncompressed little-endian 32-bit float; Nordrhein-Westfalen and
Niedersachsen return the same thing LZW-compressed; Baden-Württemberg returns
**big-endian 16-bit unsigned integers**. Read with the wrong assumption, the last
of those yields heights in the millions — which is the good case, because it is
obviously wrong. The bad case is a subtler one silently off.

A library would cover all of it. GDAL is a hundred megabytes of wheel and
`tifffile` pulls in more than this needs; the reader below is the fraction of
TIFF 6.0 that these six services actually emit, and it refuses the rest loudly
rather than guessing.
