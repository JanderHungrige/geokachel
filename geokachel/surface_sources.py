"""Services that say how tall the things standing on the ground are.

Wave 17 built a registry for terrain. This is its sibling and it answers a
different question: not *where is the ground* but *what is on it, and how far
up*. Same rule — read from each service's own capabilities, confirmed with a
real request, and a state with nothing gets no entry.

Probed on 2026-09-06. **Every one of the eight states with a terrain service has
a surface model too**, which is not a coincidence: they come from the same
airborne laser scanning, and a survey that publishes one usually publishes both.

Two products, and the difference matters more than the names suggest:

- **nDOM** — *normalised*: the surface minus the terrain, already subtracted, so
  a value is the height of a thing above the ground it stands on. Nordrhein-
  Westfalen and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern publish one. NRW's is at **0.5 m**, the
  finest raster in either registry.
- **DOM** — the raw surface, in metres above sea level like the terrain. Usable
  for the same purpose, at the cost of a second request and a subtraction, and
  of the two rasters agreeing about where they are.

A crown, a roof and a parked lorry all look the same to either of them. That is
the limit of this whole family of data and it is why the building footprints
still come from OSM: a surface model says *how tall*, and something else has to
say *what*.
