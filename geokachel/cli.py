"""Heights for any point in Germany, and whether every source still answers.

    geokachel states                              # what each Bundesland publishes
    geokachel ground 48.1374 11.5755 --state BY   # the ground there, and whose it is
    geokachel surface LAT LON --state BY --out x.tif   # roofs and trees, as a GeoTIFF
    geokachel objects LAT LON --state NW          # how tall they are
    geokachel credits BY TH                       # the exact credit those states require
    geokachel sources                             # every tile product in the registry
    geokachel check                               # ask every source, a few kB each
    geokachel check sn- rp- --quiet               # only these, and only what is wrong

**Exit code 0 when everything answered as the registry says, 1 when anything
did not** — so a scheduled job can speak up only when something has changed:

    17 4 * * 1  geokachel check --quiet || mail -s "a source moved" you@example.de

This is deliberately **not** a test suite. A suite that needs sixteen state
surveying offices to be up fails on their maintenance window, teaches people to
ignore red, and says nothing about your code. Run this on a schedule instead,
and let it be the thing that goes red.

What it costs: one small request per source, four kilobytes off the front of
each, with a pause between. Sixteen offices publishing at their own expense are
not an API with a quota — and if you are running this from CI, set
`geokachel.net.USER_AGENT` to something with your own contact in it.
