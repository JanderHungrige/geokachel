"""Undoing what a TIFF encoder did before it wrote the bytes.

Split from `tiff.py` when that file crossed three hundred lines, and the seam is
a real one: `tiff.py` is about a file's layout — where the directory is, where
the strips or tiles live — while this is about the bytes inside one of them.

Two of the eight services in the registry compress, and they do not agree on how:
Nordrhein-Westfalen uses LZW with no predictor, Niedersachsen uses LZW with the
floating-point predictor. Neither is a variation of the other and using the
wrong one produces a raster rather than an error.
