"""State elevation services that may actually be used, and their attribution.

Wave 8 asked the licence question before anything was built on imagery, and
`orthophotos.py` is the answer that came out. This is the same question asked of
terrain, and it produced the same shape of answer: a registry, not a URL.

Probed service by service on 2026-09-05, every entry read from that service's
own `GetCapabilities` and confirmed with a real 200 m `GetCoverage`. Six states
answer, and the rest are absent rather than approximated.

**Saarland is the reason this is a registry.** Its service answers, its metadata
is listed as open by every aggregator — and its own `AccessConstraints` say
"Jegliche andere Nutzung, so auch das Einbinden in weitere Anwendungen
(Download) ist kostenpflichtig". Viewing it in the state's own portal is free;
using it here is not. It is therefore not here. The coverage it serves is also
5 m rather than the DGM1 its title claims.

**The eight that are not here, each with its own reason.** "Not found" and
"does not exist" are different claims and only the first is being made:

- **Bayern** — the DGM1 *is* open (CC-BY-4.0) and downloadable, but its coverage
  service at `geoservices.bayern.de/pro/wcs/dgm/v1/wcs_inspire_dgm1` answers
  401: access needs credentials from the LDBV's customer service. Tiles are the
  only anonymous route, which is the wave plan's "secondary" and not built.
- **Saarland** — works, and says in its own `AccessConstraints` that embedding it
  in another application is kostenpflichtig. Its coverage is also 5 m.
- **Thüringen** — the geoproxy answers "No service with identifier 'WCS_DGM'
  available"; its WMS serves DGM2 and DGM5, which are pictures rather than
  heights.
- **Sachsen** — 403 on every path tried, and no WCS record for a terrain model in
  the GDI-DE catalogue.
- **Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, Rheinland-Pfalz** — no coverage service
  found, in the catalogue or by probing. SH and Hamburg publish DGM1 by download
  and as a WMS.

And the federal `sgx.geodatenzentrum.de/wcs_dgm1` answers `NOACCESS_SERVICE`
from a security gate, exactly as the BKG orthophoto endpoint did in Wave 8.

A gap here is a gap, and the model says so rather than borrowing a neighbour's
ground. Eight states is about 64 % of the population — worth being precise about
rather than rounding up.
