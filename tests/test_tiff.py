No fixtures and no network: the six services disagree in three dimensions —
byte order, sample format, and compression with two different predictors — and
every combination has to be constructible here or it cannot be regression-tested.
The files are built in `tiff_builders.py`, and the LZW stream by an encoder
written from the specification there, not by the decoder under test.
